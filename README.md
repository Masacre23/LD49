You are the novice of the office, and everyone is taking advantage of you!

- Take Calls.
- Make document copies.
- Help your coworkers.
- Repair computers.
- Keep your boss happy.
If you want to get a promotion you will have to fight for it to gain money! If not… you will probably be fired on your first day!

BUT be prepared… this UNSTABLE company could be your doom!

You can win the game if you survive 5 “real time” minutes.
You lose if the graphic goes down and stays there too much.
